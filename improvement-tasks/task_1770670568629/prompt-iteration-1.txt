   - Follow existing code patterns

6. TEST AND CAPTURE
   - Run: npm run improve capture task_1770670568629
   - Review screenshots for visual changes

7. DOCUMENT
   - Run: npm run improve note task_1770670568629 1 "what you changed"
   - Create iteration-1-notes.md with details

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- Code compiles and runs
- Visible improvements in screenshots
- Changes align with reference materials
- No broken gameplay functionality

IF YOU NEED HELP:
- Asset generation: Document in assets-needed.md
- Stuck on implementation: Document in blockers.md
- Need user input: Create questions.md
